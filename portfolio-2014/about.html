						<p>Hi, I'm Junya Wang, a UI/UX + graphic designer and front-end developer in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I just graduated from <a href="http://www.siat.sfu.ca/">School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT)</a> at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> in 2014 Summer. SIAT is an interdisciplinary future-focused school for technologists, artists and designers that concentrate on the study of interactive design, incorporating aesthetics with technical skills. Studying in SIAT provides me an opportunity to go through various project work, gain experience mainly in graphic, interface and interaction design.</p>
						
						<p>Being professional on designing, programming and applying design theories simultaneously, I can be a combination of graphic, interface and interaction designer. Being creative, having a strong sense of color and taste on style, I am good at designing and uniting the style of my work. Being patient, responsible and good at precision, even details of the project needed to be done fastidiously. With strong technical,  organization skill and comprehension, I am able to function more efficiently as a team member.</p>

					<h2>enthusiast</h2>
					<p>I currently live in Vancouver, Canada. In my spare time I enjoy listening to New Age, Classical music and original soundtracks, playing piano and violin, reading novels and interesting books with a cup of Chinese tea, watching a good movie, swimming and cooking.</p>

					<h3>photography</h3>
					<p>Besides a designer, I am glad to work as a photographer as well. I have experience taking photos with both film and digital cameras for 5 years, usually focused on landscapes, animals, portrait, street photography and documentary photography. In 2012, I have set up the <a href="http://www.vanphoto.org/">Vancouver Outdoor Photography (VOP)</a> Club with my friends and we organized several events like photo contest, photo tour and field trip after that.</p>

					<p>Photography is a mirror. It represents my unique perspective and reflects the inside of me. Cameras are my eyes. They help me to record what I observe and express what I feel. My photography experience brings me deeper self-cognition and witnesses my growth.</p>

					<h3>music</h3>
					<p>Music is my soul. My musical taste is New Age, Classical and OST. Music has gifted me both intelligence and friends. As a part of me, it cannot be taken away. I started professional piano training in 1994 and started self-learning violin and a vertical bamboo flute recently. One day I found fresh music pieces started to poped out from my head so I started to compose music. My first piano music was composed and self-recorded in 2011. From then on, I also had experience creating music with Protools and Logic Pro using MIDI keyboard, based on both academic and self training.</p>
			  
					<h3>drawing and painting</h3>
					<p>I love the feeling of turning a sheet of blank paper into a gorgeous and meaningful picture. Although I haven't receive any formal training, with more than 10 years experience of drawing and painting, I could do both freehand and digitally.</p>

					</p>
			  
					<h3>handcrafts</h3>
					<p>Turning something useless or wasted to exquisite handcrafts is like giving the materials new lifes. I have been carving rubber stamps since 2011. I also enjoy DIY and making models in design process as physical prototypes. Handcrafts helped me to enjoy life more and learn to be more calm and patient.</p>
