					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This realistic rendered room was done for an academic project of my 3D Animation course in SFU. My goal was to create a photo-realistic enviroment through modeling in Maya, and apply texture, light to make it more realistic.</p>

					<h2>Composition and Mood</h2>
					<p>My composition was a room interior with windows towards the south, so when the afternoon comes, the sunlight will falls into the room at a diagonal angel and warm the whole room. I wanted to create this vintage living room in a warm and calm afternoon. The weather is sunny but a little windy, as you can see from the flying curtains. The mood is relaxing, leisurely and cozy.</p>

					<h2>Modeling Process</h2>					
					<p><strong>Violin</strong> was the most difficult object to model in this project.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin</strong> body was started with its edge, by extruding a polygonal cube through a curve. Then I extruded the innere edge to make half of the violin body. I use boolean to make the F holes, and readjust the wiring and radian. Finally I used duplicate more to make the other half, reflected by y axis.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin scroll</strong> and <strong>neck</strong> was made from a single polygonal piece, rearrange points height to make the spiral shape, add surfaces, then extrude it.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin fingerboard</strong> was created by a polygonal cube, then use scale tool and move vertices to make the curved shape.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin bridge</strong> was started with a polygonal cube, delete other faces and keep only the front face. Then I rearranged the vertices and edges to make the outline and inner pattern, then extrude it to a 3D shape. After that, I used lattices to make the upper edge thinner, and then mirror it by x axis.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin peg</strong> was started with a polygonal cube, then delete other faces to keep 1 face. Then I rearrange the vertices, extrude, duplicate special to make the "head" of the peg. Then I make the long cylinder by using revolve, and make the little dot using polygonal sphere. After that, I align them using align tool, then group them together, and duplicate special to make the other 3 pegs.</p>
					<p><strong>Violin strings</strong> was modeled by creating Bezier curves and different radius circles first, then select both and extrude the 3D shape.</p>
					<p><strong>Sofa</strong> was started from a polygon cube, then use subdivisions, extrude, insert edge loop and basic transformation tools to adjust the shape. For the mattress, I followed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrPvGXmkTqg">online tutorial</a> to make it. The tool I used was basically poke face.</p>
					<p><strong>Wine bottles</strong> and <strong>wine glass</strong> was modeled by creating Bezier curves first, then use revolve tool to make the 3D shape.</p>
					<p><strong>Wine bottle label</strong> was created by a NURBS surface plane, then change it to a curved shape through controlling the vertices.</p>
					<p><strong>Curtains</strong> and the <strong>map</strong> were created using NURBS surface plane. I changed the shape by readjusting its vertices using soft selection.</p>
					<p><strong>Pillows</strong> were started from a polygon, subdivided it into 4x4x3, then move vertices to make the shape soft.</p>
					<p><strong>Walls</strong>, <strong>floor</strong>, and the <strong>carpet</strong> were created using polygon plane. The <strong>windows</strong> were created by subdividing the wall, removing faces, extruding and inserting edge loops.</p>

					<h2>Texture Materials</h2>
					<p>NOTE*: Since it is in mental ray mode, all the surface materials I used were Mia material x passes. However, the values and settings are set differently for matching their own materials.</p><br />
                        <p><strong>Violin front body</strong> was using a wood violin texture with vertical bumps. I used plane UV to project to the front of the violin. It has little reflection, and glossiness value almost equals to 0.<p>
                        <p><strong>Violin back body</strong> was using a wood violin back texture, then use plane UV to project it to the back of the violin. It has little reflection, and glossiness value almost equals to 0.<p>
                        <p><strong>Violin finger board</strong>, <strong>tailpiece</strong> and <strong>chinrest</strong> was using a black wood material, with little reflection, glossiness value almost 0.<p>
                        <p><strong>Violin bridge</strong> was using a light color wood texture and projected by plane UV. It has little reflection, and glossiness value almost equals to 0.<p>
                        <p><strong>Violin strings </strong>was using default mia material x pass grey color, without using any texture. The reflection and glossiness are like 0.3.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sofa</strong> was using a light green fabric texture. I wanted to use leather texture actually, but large and good leather texture is to difficult to find online. I decrease the reflection to about 0.2, with glossiness about 0.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pillows</strong> were using 2 different fabric textures by spherical UV mapping. The reflection and glossiness are both about 0.<p>
                        <p><strong>Walls</strong> were applied a purple vintage wallpaper texture to create the vintage looking and feeling. The reflection and glossiness are almost 0.</p>
                        <p><strong>Window frame</strong> was using a white wood texture with a little bumps using 6 faces auto UV mapping. It has little reflection and the glossiness was almost 0.</p>
                        <p><strong>Curtains</strong> were using the same fabric as the sofa, but with low reflection, low glossiness, high transparency and refraction of light green.</p>
                        <p><strong>Map</strong> was using a vintage map image found online. The reflection and glossiness were both 0, to mimic the paper feeling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Floor</strong> was applied a wood floor texture, with a little bit of reflection, and very low glossiness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Carpet</strong> was applied a vintage carpet texture, with 0 reflection and 0 glossiness. </p>
                        <p><strong>Wine bottles</strong>was using the default mia material x pass, with high transparency and color of green and brown. Both have high refraction value. The reflection is almost 1 and glossiness is almost 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wine glasses</strong> was using the default mia material x pass, with high transparency, clear color, and high refraction value. The reflection is almost 1 and glossiness is almost 1. </p>
                        <p><strong>Wine bottle label</strong> was applied a wine label texture, with 0 reflection and 0 glossiness to mimic the paper feeling.</p>

					<h2>Lighting</h2>
					<p><strong>Mental ray sunlight and sky</strong> was a directional light, positioned outside of the window, a little bit higher comparing to the window, pointing into the room at a angel about 30 degree. This light was the main light. I changed the Red/Blue shift to 0.300 to create this warm sunlight for the atmosphere of a warm and calm afternoon. The intensity was 7. </p>
                    <p><strong>2 area lights</strong> were positioned right on the window and point into the room. The light source is from the outside, travel to the room through the windows. It is a sub key light to fill the sunlight. The color is white and intensity is 0.7. </p>
                    <p><strong>Another area light</strong> was positioned inside the room on the left of the sofa, and pointing towards the sofa area. This light is a fill light to give some lights for the shadow created by sunlight and 2 area lights on the right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Volumetric light</strong> was positioned from the window to the light area of the wall. It was in a box shape, and I use it to create the Tyndall effect, where you can see a little dust and fog under the sunshine.</p>
