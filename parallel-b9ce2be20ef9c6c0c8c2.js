Gear VR uses gaze, tap, swipe, voice, and it has a back button. HTC Vive has controllers for users to interact. For Leap Motion, users can use hand gestures. But since we want to focus on mobile, we had two options left: Google Cardboard or Gear VR. Since we wanted the app to be on both Android and iOS, the only choice left was Google Cardboard.
